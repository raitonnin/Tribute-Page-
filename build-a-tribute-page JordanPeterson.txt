<h4>His political impact</h4>
<p>One of the largest reasons he came to prominence was his pushback against bill c-16 in Canada. A Bill to compell speech, which he was directly opposed to suggesting its totalitarian leanings. He regarded the bill as an anti-free speech bill saying that if you were to be arrested for mis-use of a pronoun, the future implications were serious for other speech. This garnered him harsh criticism but strong followers, he already had a following of people who believed in his works at the time. This situation where he had spoke out politically had only truely gotten him more publicity.</p>

The impact is able to be felt by anyone if they are willing to listen and give his advice a try. He has 5.25 million followers on youtube at the time of writing, and that is no small number. He has just joined up with the Daily Wire's new venture Daily Wire+ to have new forms of content meaning he will not be tied to one outlet. His following has grown as the years grow by exponentially.</p>
